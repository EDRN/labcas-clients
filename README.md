# 💁 LabCAS Clients

Various clients for the LabCAS API.


## ℹ️ What's Here

Right now, just this:

- `labcas_download.ps1` — a Windows PowerShell script that reads a local `files.csv` (which isn't really a CSV but just a list of file URLs, one per line) that uses the LabCAS API to download each file. Note that to run this script on Windows 11, you'll need to run PowerShell as Administrator, and first enter the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
